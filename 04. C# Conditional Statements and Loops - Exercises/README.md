## 1.Exercises: C# Conditional Statements and Loops

Problems for exercises and homework for the [&quot;Programming Fundamentals&quot; course @ SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/courses/programming-fundamentals).

## Problem 1.Choose a Drink

Write a program, which receives a **profession** (as a **string** ) and chooses the perfect **drink** for the person. The possible combinations are:

- &quot; **Water**&quot; – for &quot; **Athlete**&quot;
- &quot; **Coffee**&quot; – for &quot; **Businessman**&quot; or &quot; **Businesswoman**&quot;
- &quot; **Beer**&quot; – for &quot; **SoftUni Student**&quot;
- &quot; **Tea**&quot; – for all **other professions**.



## Problem 2.Choose a Drink 2.0

Your program needs to get smarter. Now you will receive on the second line the quantities of the drink and you have to print the calculated the price. You can see the prices of the drinks in the table below:

|   | **Water** | **Coffee** | **Beer** | **Tea** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Price** | 0.70 | 1.00 | 1.70 | 1.20 |

### Input

The **input** will be on two lines:

- On the **first**** line **, you will receive the** profession**
- On the **second** line, you will receive the **quantity** as an **integer**.

### Output

Print the output in the following format:

The {profession} has to pay {totalPrice}.

**Format** the **price** to the **2**

# nd
 **decimal place**.
### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| Athlete1 | The Athlete has to pay 0.70. |
| SoftUni Student8 | The SoftUni Student has to pay 13.60 |
| Chef3 | The Chef has to pay 3.60. |

## Problem 3.Restaurant Discount

A restaurant want to automate their reservation process. They need a program that reads the **hall** and the **count of people** from the console and calculates **how much** the customer should **pay** to book the place.

Different halls have different prices:

|   | **Small Hall** | **Terrace** | **Great Hall** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Price** | 2500$ | 5000$ | 7500$ |
| **Capacity** | 50 | 100 | 120 |

The restaurant has **discounts** depending on the **service package,** which the group wants.

 You can see the discounts in the table below:

|   | **Normal** | **Gold** | **Platinum** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Discount** | 5% | 10% | 15% |
| **Price** | 500$ | 750$ | 1000$ |

You should **add** the **price** of the **package** to the **price** of the **hall**. The discount is calculated based on the **hall&#39;s price + package&#39;s price**.

Example: The group has **10 people** and wants the **gold package**  ****  **$292.50 per person** :

- **10 people** \&lt;= 50 they get the **Small Hall** $2500
- Gold package **$750** , **10%** discount on the entire purchase
- Total price: **$2500 + $750** = **$3250**
- Discount: $3250 - **10% discount** = $2925
- Price per person: $2925 / **10 people** = **$292.50 per person**

You should print **which hall** is the **most suitable** for the group and the **price per person**. If the group is **bigger than 120** people – print &quot; **We do not have an appropriate hall.**&quot;.

### Input

- First line: the **group size** as an **integer**
- Second line: the **package** as a **string**

### Output

Print the output in the following format:

| We can offer you the {hallName}The price per person is {price}$ |
| --- |

**Format** the **price** to the **2**

# nd
 **decimal place**.
### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 20Gold | We can offer you the **Small Hall** The price per person is **146.25$** |
| 90Platinum | We can offer you the **Terrace** The price per person is **56.67$** |
| 150Normal | We do not have an appropriate hall. |

## Problem 4.Hotel

A hotel has three types of rooms: **studio** , **double** and **master suite**. The prices are different for the different months:

| **May and October** | **June and September** | **July, August and December** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Studio - **50** leva per night | Studio - **60** leva per night | Studio - **68** leva per night |
| Double - **65** leva per night | Double - **72** leva per night | Double - **77** leva per night |
| Suite - **75** leva per night | Suite - **82** leva per night | Suite - **89** leva per night |

They have also the following discounts:

- For **studio** and **more than 7** nights in **May and October** : **5% discount**
- For **double** and **more than 14** nights in **June and September** : **10% discount**
- For **suite** and **more than 14** nights in **July,**** August and December **:** 15% discount**
- For **studio** and **more than 7** nights in **September and October** : **one night is free**

### Input

The input consists of exactly **2 lines** :

- First line: **Month** – **May**** , **** June ****,**  **July**** , **** August ****,**  **September**** , October **or** December**
- Second line: **Nights Count** – **an integer between**** [0 ****... 200****]**

### Output

Print **3 lines** on the console:

- On **the first** : &quot; **Studio: {price for the stay} lv****.**&quot;
- On **the second** : &quot; **Double**** : { ****price for the stay**** } **** lv ****.**&quot;
- On **the third: &quot;**** Suite: { ****price for the stay**** } lv. ****&quot;**

**Format** the **prices** to the **2**

# nd
 **decimal place**.
### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | **Comment** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| June5 | Studio: 300.00 lv.Double: 360.00 lv.Suite: 410.00 lv. | The **nights are not enough** for getting a discount, so the studio is 60 lv, **double room = 72** and apartment = 82. We **multiply the prices by the nights** and get the total prices. |

| **Input** | **Output** | **Comment** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| May10 | Studio: 475.00 lv.Double: 650.00 lv.Suite: 750.00 lv. | In May, we have a discount of **5%** , when the nights are **more than 7**.That means the **price for night** in the studios is **50 \* 0.95 = 47.5**. Again, we **multiply the prices by the nights** and get the total prices. |

| **Input** | **Output** |   | **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| July16 | Studio: 1088.00 lv.Double: 1232.00 lv.Suite: 1210.40 lv. |   | September10 | Studio: 540.00 lv.Double: 720.00 lv.Suite: 820.00 lv. |

1. Problem 15.\* Neighbour Wars

Gosho and Pesho are neighbours, but they don&#39;t like each other very much. They don&#39;t like violence as well, so they decided they need a save environment where they can fight each other. They hired you to write a program, which calculates who would win the fight.

Gosho and Pesho have their own signature attacks – **Gosho** attacks with &quot; **Thunderous fist**&quot; **on every even turn** of the game and **Pesho** attacks with &quot; **Roundhouse kick**&quot; **on every odd turn**. You will receive **how much damage these attacks do from the console**.

**Both players start with 100 Health points**. On **every third turn** Pesho and Gosho **restore 10 Health Points**. Health points are restored **after the attack is made**.

When one of the **player&#39;s health is below or equal to zero** you should **stop any other further operations** and **print who the winner is** , **how much health points** he hasandin **which turn** he won. Since Mike Tyson is the judge of the match, the winning round is always printed with &quot; **th**&quot; in the end.

### Input

The input is read from the console and consists of two lines:

- **First line** – **Pesho&#39;s damage**
- **Second line** – **Gosho&#39;s damage**

### Output

Print on every turn who is attacking and how much health the opponent is after the attack:

&quot;{name of the attacker} used {name of the attack} and reduced {name of the defending player} to {health of the defending player} health.&quot;

When one of the players is **dead** print:

&quot;{name of the winner} won in {number of the round}th round.&quot;

### Constraints

- **Pesho&#39;s damage** and **Gosho&#39;s damage** will be **integers** in the interval **[0…100]**
- There will **always** be a **winner**

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | **Comments** |
